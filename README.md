# Football-Analysis-System
## Introduction
The Football Analysis System is a comprehensive project designed to detect and analyze players, referees, and footballs in video footage using the YOLO object detection model. The project also aims to measure important game statistics like team ball possession, player movement, and speed using various computer vision techniques, including KMeans clustering, optical flow, and perspective transformation.

## Project Features
- Player and Object Detection: Detects and tracks players, referees, and footballs in real-time      using YOLO.
- Team Classification: Uses KMeans for pixel segmentation to differentiate teams based on t-shirt 
  color.
- Ball Possession Analysis: Calculates each teamâ€™s ball acquisition percentage.
- Camera Motion Analysis: Utilizes optical flow to track camera movement for frame-by-frame 
  analysis.
- Perspective Transformation: Enables measurement of distances in meters for accurate tracking of 
  player movement.
- Player Speed and Distance Metrics: Calculates individual player speed and distance covered.
